# Visual-servo-positioning-based-on-CBN-YOLO
It is used for automatic positioning of fastening bolts of electrified railway contact network, and can also be transferred to automatic positioning of some small-sized targets.


Subsequent codes will be uploaded after the relevant paper is accepted.

This project was created as part of the manuscript submission titled 'Enhanced Bolt Positioning for Electrified Railway Catenary Systems via Small Object Detection and Depth-Aware Visual Servoing' to The Visual Computer.
